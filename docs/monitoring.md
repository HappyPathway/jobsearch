# Monitoring with Pydantic Logfire

## Overview
Pydantic Logfire would provide real-time insights into our AI-powered job search operations. It's specifically designed for monitoring LLM-based applications and integrates natively with Pydantic-AI.

## Key Metrics We'd Get

### 1. LLM Interaction Metrics
- **Token Usage**: Track tokens used per job analysis
- **Response Times**: Monitor how long job analyses take
- **Completion Rate**: Track successful vs failed completions
- **Model Performance**: Compare different Gemini model versions

Example dashboard metrics:
```
Average Analysis Time: 2.3s
Daily Token Usage: 45,000
Success Rate: 98.2%
Cost per Analysis: $0.002
```

### 2. Job Search Quality Metrics
- **Match Score Distribution**: How well jobs match profiles
- **False Positive Rate**: Jobs marked as matches that weren't
- **Search Effectiveness**: Number of relevant jobs per search
- **Analysis Consistency**: Variance in job analysis results

Example insights:
```
Top Performing Searches:
- "Senior Python Developer": 85% relevant results
- "Cloud Architect": 78% relevant results
- "DevOps Engineer": 72% relevant results
```

### 3. Error Tracking
- **Structured Error Logging**: Categorized error types
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure modes
- **Recovery Rates**: How often retry mechanisms succeed
- **Impact Analysis**: Which errors affect user experience

Error breakdown example:
```
Error Types (Last 24h):
- Rate Limiting: 45%
- Parsing Failures: 30%
- Network Issues: 15%
- Other: 10%
```

### 4. User Experience Metrics
- **Search Response Time**: End-to-end search latency
- **Analysis Quality**: User feedback on job matches
- **Feature Usage**: Most used search parameters
- **Session Success**: Completed job applications per search

Performance example:
```
Average Response Times:
- Initial Search: 0.8s
- Full Analysis: 3.2s
- Document Generation: 2.1s
```

## Implementation Example

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.monitoring import LogfireMonitoring

# Configure monitoring
monitoring = LogfireMonitoring(
    project_id="jobsearch-ai",
    environment="production"
)

class JobSearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.search_agent = Agent(
            'google-gla:gemini-1.5-pro',
            output_type=List[JobListing],
            system_prompt="...",
            monitoring=monitoring,  # Enable monitoring
            instrumentation={
                'track_tokens': True,
                'track_latency': True,
                'track_errors': True,
                'track_retries': True
            }
        )
```

## Real-time Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- High error rates
- Unusual token usage
- Performance degradation
- Cost spikes

Example alert configuration:
```python
monitoring.set_alert(
    name="high_error_rate",
    condition="error_rate > 0.05",  # 5% error rate
    window="5m",  # 5-minute window
    channels=["slack", "email"]
)
```

## Cost Analysis

Track and optimize costs:
- Token usage by feature
- Cost per successful job match
- ROI on different search strategies
- Budget monitoring and alerts

Example cost report:
```
Monthly Cost Breakdown:
- Job Search: $125.30
- Job Analysis: $245.80
- Document Generation: $89.50
Total: $460.60
```

## Performance Optimization

Use monitoring data to:
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize prompt strategies
- Improve caching efficiency
- Reduce unnecessary API calls

Example optimization insight:
```
Identified Opportunities:
1. Cache frequently searched job types
2. Batch similar analyses
3. Optimize prompt length
Estimated Savings: 25% reduction in API costs
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**:
```bash
pip install pydantic-ai[logfire]
```

2. **Configuration**:
```python
# config/monitoring.py
LOGFIRE_CONFIG = {
    'project_id': 'jobsearch-ai',
    'environment': os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'development'),
    'service_name': 'job-search',
    'sampling_rate': 1.0  # Monitor all requests
}
```

3. **Integration**:
```python
# features/job_search/search_v2.py
from jobsearch.config.monitoring import LOGFIRE_CONFIG
from pydantic_ai.monitoring import LogfireMonitoring

monitoring = LogfireMonitoring(**LOGFIRE_CONFIG)

class JobSearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.search_agent = Agent(
            'google-gla:gemini-1.5-pro',
            monitoring=monitoring,
            instrument=True
        )
```

4. **Dashboard Setup**:
- Create custom dashboards
- Configure alerts
- Set up regular reports

## Benefits

1. **Operational**:
- Early warning system for issues
- Clear visibility into performance
- Data-driven optimization
- Automated monitoring

2. **Business**:
- Cost optimization
