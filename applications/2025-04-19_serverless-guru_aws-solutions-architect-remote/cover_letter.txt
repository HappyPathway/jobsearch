Dear Mr. Arnold,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the AWS Solutions Architect (Remote) position at Serverless Guru, as advertised on LinkedIn.  My deep experience in designing, implementing, and managing serverless architectures on AWS, coupled with my passion for cloud-native principles and serverless technologies, aligns perfectly with your requirements.  I am particularly drawn to Serverless Guru's focus on cutting-edge serverless solutions and the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic, remote team.

In my current role as Sr. Cloud SME at FedSoft, Inc., I lead cloud modernization initiatives, architecting and implementing scalable, multi-cloud solutions leveraging AWS and Terraform. I have developed reusable Terraform modules to ensure best practices and compliance, automated infrastructure provisioning and governance for increased efficiency, and implemented robust security controls using HashiCorp Vault and AWS IAM. This experience directly mirrors the requirements of your role and demonstrates my ability to deliver impactful results in a fast-paced environment.

Prior to FedSoft, I served as an Infra Architect at Clover, where I designed and deployed secure, high-performance cloud infrastructure on AWS, also using Terraform. I architected Kubernetes-based container platforms and integrated cost optimization strategies. Furthermore, my experience leading a cloud migration initiative and implementing DevSecOps practices, achieving compliance with SOC 2, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001, showcases my ability to navigate complex projects and deliver secure, compliant solutions. My time at HashiCorp as a Sr. Solutions Engineer further solidified my expertise in Terraform and Vault, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of IaC best practices and security automation.

My proficiency extends to key AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and Step Functions, which I have leveraged extensively throughout my career. I am confident in my ability to contribute immediately to your team and am eager to learn and grow within the serverless domain.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am excited about the prospect of joining Serverless Guru and contributing to your continued success. I have attached my resume for your review and welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
